# __WebSite - RusNews__
***
## This project is a frontend maket for a website with Russian news articles. The site should publish articles related to current news in Russia. By going to each of them, you can open the article via a separate link and read it in full. The site also has navigation and buttons with links to possible relevant social-app.
***
At the moment, the site is developed from the point of view of the frontend and already has a lot of developments:
- Fully developed Ð¡SS styles.
- A database associated with JSON files, which contains brief (for "main.html") and complete information (for "article.html") about articles with links to photo material.
- __Light and dark mode__ using JS.
- Fully developed website scalability, even for the mobile version of the website.
- __Integration of published articles__ on the main page ("main.html"), where if there are fewer than 3 elements with a summary of the article, then the site does not display the "See more" button.
- When you click on a photo or the caption "Read more" you are redirected to a page that is loaded using a layout and data synchronization based on the summary of the article.
***
The site is under development and has some shortcomings that should be fixed over time. Examples of them are:
- Lack of a backend.
- The lack of development of the __"input"__ field on all HTML pages, which should search for user-entered text in a json file ("erticles-row.json") and output the desired short article.
- The lack of traffic and the dynamism of the site using JS.
- The absence of an error panel for the administrator, testing, domain, and the well-established process of the entire project as a whole.

### __RusNews__ was basically created using markup languages snd JavaScript.
#### This website design was taken from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Eyy8zaOTJVtt79QRNZXcFc/Minimal-Blog-(Community)?m=auto&t=ssvhwcclJXvcOHPF-6), which was slightly modified during the development process.
